# image_classification.py
This Python code performs image classification using ImageAI and a MobileNetV2 model. I learned about these concepts through the ZeroToMastery Academy

# Modification: 
The project was originally called brain.py, but I  changed the name because it sounds closely to what has been done

# Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the "image_classification.py" script: python image_classification.py
  a. Make sure you called the script with the correct version (your version) of python
4. After execution, the script will classify the provided image using the MobileNetV2 model and print the top 5 predictions along with their probabilities of resemblance.
5. Due to the file size, only the MobileNetV2 was uploaded. But if you want to make use of other algorithms, for a better prediction, you can find them at this link: "https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/tree/master/imageai/Classification" after the TABLE OF CONTENTS, before FirstPrediction.py

# Example Output
After running the script, you will see an output similar to the following:
common iguana  :  47.0019
American alligator:  32.1234
triceratops:  9.9208
frilled lizard:  6.3106
African crocodile:  0.3448

# Note
You may encounter warnings during execution related to deprecated features or future changes in the libraries used. These warnings can typically be ignored, but it's recommended to keep your dependencies updated to avoid potential issues in the future.
